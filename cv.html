            <!-- <h2>International Business Managment (IT) (B.Sc.)</h2> -->
            <h1>My plans for the year 2026</h1>
            <h3>Forword</h3>
            <p>In february of 2026 I will finish my apprentinship at D+H Software GmbH. At D+H Software we produce a 3D furniture planning software called "furnplan". Due to us being active in the furniture industry I regulary attend furniture fairs. I love globalization and connection with people around the world as you can probably tell by my travel page I like to travel a lot. 
            </p> 


           International <h3> Business Management (B.Sc.)</h3>
            <p>
                
                I believe that with the foundation of my training as an IT Sales Specialist, I am perfectly equipped for further studies, and that pursuing a degree is the right step in advancing my career. I am confident that a evening study program to further my education while working full-time is the right choice for me.

                
                I am positive that this will help me grow both personally and professionally.
            </p>
            <h1>Why I Want to Work in International Sales</h1>

            <h2>Passion for Intercultural Exchange</h2>
            <p>
              From an early age, I’ve been fascinated by other cultures—through travel, language immersion, and working with international teams. In today’s interconnected world, adaptability and cultural awareness are essential. That’s exactly where my strengths and passion lie.
            </p>
            <p>
              International sales brings together business strategy and cultural intelligence—two areas that inspire and drive me.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Strategic Thinking & Customer Focus</h2>
            <p>
              For me, sales is more than just closing deals—it's about building long-term partnerships, understanding client needs, and delivering tailored solutions. I enjoy working analytically and finding the right fit for each situation, especially when I can truly help others succeed.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Languages as a Bridge</h2>
            <p>
              With strong fluency in German, English, and French, I can adapt to diverse international settings. I see languages not just as tools, but as bridges—opening doors, building trust, and enabling real connection.
            </p>
        
            <h2>My Vision</h2>
            <p>
              I see my future in a global environment. I want to contribute to connecting people and markets—through curiosity, empathy, and dedication. International sales is the perfect field for me to unite business, communication, and culture.
            </p>
        
            <blockquote>
              "To me, sales isn’t about convincing—it’s about helping someone find the right solution. On a global scale."
