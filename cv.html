            <!-- <h2>International Business Managment (IT) (B.Sc.)</h2> -->
            <h1>My Plans for 2026</h1>
            <p>
              In 2026, I will complete my apprenticeship at D+H Software GmbH and continue my part-time degree in International Business Management, which I started in 2025. Starting in March 2026, I am seeking a full-time position—preferably in the furniture or energy industry. I’m especially interested in working for an international company where I can contribute to global collaboration and develop in a dynamic, cross-cultural environment.
              
              I bring hands-on experience from the tech-driven furniture sector and a strong interest in sustainable innovation—making both industries especially exciting to me. My goal is to apply my skills in sales, communication, and strategic thinking while learning from a global team. I value international collaboration and am motivated to take on new challenges that support both personal and professional growth.
            </p>


            
            <h1>Why I Want to Work in International Sales</h1>

            <h2>Passion for Intercultural Exchange</h2>
            <p>
              From an early age, I have been fascinated by other cultures—through travel, language immersion, and working with international teams. In today’s interconnected world, adaptability and cultural awareness are essential. That’s exactly where my strengths and passion lie.
            </p>
            <p>
              International sales brings together business strategy and cultural intelligence—two areas that inspire and drive me.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Strategic Thinking & Customer Focus</h2>
            <p>
              For me, sales is more than just closing deals—it's about building long-term partnerships, understanding client needs, and delivering tailored solutions. I enjoy working analytically and finding the right fit for each situation, especially when I can truly help others succeed.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Languages as a Bridge</h2>
            <p>
              With strong fluency in German, English, Portuguese, and Dutch—as well as a solid command of Spanish and ongoing studies in French—I bring a broad linguistic foundation to any international setting. I see languages not just as tools for communication, but as bridges that foster cultural understanding, build trust, and enable meaningful collaboration across borders. My passion for languages reflects a deeper commitment to global engagement and intercultural competence, both of which are essential in today’s connected world.
            </p>
        
            <h2>My Vision</h2>
            <p>
              I see my future in a global environment. I want to contribute to connecting people and markets—through curiosity, empathy, and dedication. International sales is the perfect field for me to unite business, communication, and culture.
            </p>
