                In 2026, I plan to embark on a degree in International IT Management, with the ambitious goal of studying in three different countries. While I understand this may seem idealistic, my hope is to inspire universities to support me on this unique journey.

            <p>Through this page, I aim to share my vision and connect with institutions that see the potential in turning this dream into reality. This program represents more than just an academic pursuit—it’s a chance to deepen my expertise in IT and business strategy, foster personal growth, and build connections with people from diverse cultures and backgrounds. I am excited about the opportunity to explore new perspectives, develop as an individual, and contribute meaningfully to the global community.

    <h1>Hi, I’m Lucas,</h1>        
    <p>
        a 20-year-old German-Brazilian currently living in Ahaus, Germany. Traveling and sports are my greatest passions, and I’m always eager to embrace new experiences and adventures. My ultimate goal is to explore as much of the world as possible while making the most of every moment. Setting and achieving goals drives me, and I channel that energy into every aspect of my life.
    <br>
        I would describe myself as a dynamic personality, capable of adapting to any situation. Whether as a calm and attentive listener or a bundle of enthusiasm, I bring energy and balance to the moment. Sports play a significant role in my life—I’m highly competitive and always push myself to stay at the top of my game. Whether it’s playing soccer, hitting the gym, or taking on a personal 60-day fitness challenge, I enjoy pushing my limits.
        
        In my free time, you’ll often find me traveling, discovering new places, and sharing my adventures. Feel free to check out some of my latest trips on my [Travel Blog]! 
        <br>
        Beyond that, I thrive on staying productive and continuously growing. This could mean learning new skills like creating a website, hosting my own server, or diving into a great book.I thrive on staying busy and productive. When I’m not working, exercising, or spending time with friends and family, I dedicate time to personal growth. This could mean learning new skills like creating a website, hosting my own server, or simply diving into a good book.

<h2>Academic and Professional Background</h2> 
<p>
    I graduated from high school in Germany in 2023 and am currently training to become an IT Sales Specialist at D+H Software. My time at D+H has been incredibly rewarding—not only do I enjoy my field of work, but I’m also grateful for the supportive environment and my amazing colleagues.
    
    D+H has been a significant stepping stone in my journey, and I’ve been transparent with my plans to pursue studies abroad after completing my training. One of the highlights of my time here was successfully negotiating a raise during my training period, something that is uncommon in Germany. This experience taught me the importance of confidence, honesty, and standing up for what I believe in.
</p>

<h2>Passion for Cultures and Languages</h2> 
<p>
Alongside my passion for IT and sales, I have a deep love for languages and cultures. I currently speak five languages: German, English, Portuguese, Dutch, and Spanish. I’m also learning French in my free time at a local school. I believe that mastering languages is not just a skill but a gateway to understanding and connecting with people from around the world.
