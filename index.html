        I am        Lucas Kowalski, and I am from Ahaus, Germany. I am passionate about sports, traveling, making new friendships, learning new languages, and developing new skills—like building this website!

        I am 20 years old and have the German high school diploma (Abitur). Currently, I am a trainee at D+H Software. I speak five languages and am currently learning my sixth.
        <br>

        In 2026, I plan to study abroad because I love exploring the world and expanding my knowledge. My goal is to pursue a degree in International Business Management with IT, building on my apprenticeship as an IT sales specialist.
        <br>
         Ideally, I would like to earn a joint degree from two or three universities abroad.

        <!-- <p>        
                20 years old german/brazilian male living in Ahaus, germany. Traveling and sports are my passion. My goal is to travel as much as possible, I am down for any  experience/travel. I always try to make the best out of any given moment. I love setting goals and working towards them. In my free time I enjoy traveling. 

                Get into some of my latest trips on my Travelblog :-)

                I would call myself a bit twisted, Depending on the needed mood I am either a calm personality with a open ear or the Enthusiasmus full bundle of joy. 

                I am a competetiv person when it comes to sports,  I always try to stay on top, and believe that in order to make the most of myself i have to be as fit as possibly. Next to playing soccer i also started going to the gym regulary. Currently I am having a 60 days challenge with myself.

                I enjoy it when i have something to do rather then doom scrolling on my phone. If I am not working, excercising or spending time with friends and family. I try to educate further either by learning new skills like creating a website, hosting my own server or reading.

                I finished german high school in 2023 and since then i am in training to becoming a IT-Sales person at D+H Software. I love working for D+H, I enjoy my field of work, my coworks are great and they have a open ear for me whenever needet. For a matter of facts they are aware of my plans for going abroad to study after finishing my training. 

                I believe that its important to be honest with your surrounding human beings. I am not scared to open my mouth if something is bothering me or I feel like that something should change. For e.g. asking for a raise even due being still in training (witch is quiet unusual in germany), due to being able to justify it I got a raise. 

                Next to my passion for sales and IT I also love different cultures and languages, I currently speak 5 languages and am learning my sixth. I speak german, english, portuguese, dutch spanish as well as currently learning french at a local school in my free time.
                Best regards,
                Lucas
